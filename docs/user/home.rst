Once logged in, the user will be presented with the "Home Page". From this page, the user will see a list of all of the
documents that they have worked on recently. In the middle of the page, there is a list of projects that the user has 
access too.

From the Home Page, one can click on any of the links in the **navigation bar**. To access **Projects** and the
associated resources, click on the Projects button.

You can also use the search box in the top navigation bar to search for documents based on the document name,
the author, tags, and the description text of the document. Using the search box at this level will search over all of the
documents that you have permissions to view.

In addition to the search box, there is also the "Add Resources" button in the top right corner (the + button).
If you click this button then you can add Organizations and Projects if you have the correct permissions.

Breadcrumbs & Resource Menu
---------------------------

When the user has navigated to a particular resource, they will be presented with both a breadcrumb, as well as, a menu
at the top of the page. To illustrate, here is what a documents breadcrumb and top menu might look like for a manager.

The breadcrumb shows the containing resources, in this example, the Project and the Organization. These are links that
the user can use to navigate to a higher resource quickly, if needed. The top menu shows all of the operations that are
available for the resource and current user.
